A separate room is available for nursing or prayer.

## Transport

The venue is well-connected to public transport

- close to Düsseldorf's central train station: 16 min walk, or three subway stops (U75/76/78/79) to Heinrich-Heine-Allee (and then a 4min walk) or Schadowstraße (and then a 4min walk)
- 25 min by public transport from the airport (DUS)
- See [directions](https://www.hdu.hhu.de/en/directions-contact-details) at the venue website

Travel by car is inconvenient, with little and only expensive parking space (~20€+ per day) available in Düsseldorf.
You will likely travel faster and more hassle-free with public transport.
